# GTM & Monetization Strategy — RizeOS Mini AI-HRMS

---

## 1. Target Segments & HR Personas

### Primary Target — SMBs (11–200 employees)

The sweet spot for this product. These companies are too big for spreadsheets but too small to afford enterprise HRMS tools like Darwinbox or SAP SuccessFactors.

**Pain points:**
- Managing tasks and workforce visibility across teams is messy
- No data-driven way to assign work or measure productivity
- HR managers are doing everything manually with no AI support

**Persona:** HR Manager or Founder-who-does-HR at a 20–150 person startup
**Budget:** ₹2,000–₹8,000/month per tool
**Decision maker:** HR Manager, COO, or Founder

---

### Secondary Target — Growth-stage startups (200–500 employees)

Companies that have outgrown basic tools and need AI-driven workforce insights without building an internal data team.

**Persona:** Head of People & Culture
**Budget:** ₹8,000–₹20,000/month

---

### Tertiary Target — Staffing & outsourcing firms

Managing workforce across multiple client organizations. The multi-org architecture and blockchain payroll proof are a strong hook here — immutable on-chain records solve a real compliance problem for staffing companies.

## 5. Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Gap we fill |
|-----------|-------------|
| Zoho People | No AI task assignment, no Web3 capability |
| Keka | Too expensive for SMBs, no smart assignment |
| Darwinbox | Enterprise-only, complex 3-month onboarding |
| Spreadsheets | No visibility, no automation, no AI |
| **RizeOS HRMS** | AI-native, Web3-ready, SMB-friendly, live in 5 minutes |

**Core differentiator:** The only SMB HRMS that tells you exactly who on your team should handle any task — with an explainable AI score showing skill match, current workload, and performance history. Combined with blockchain payroll verification, it is built for the future of workforce management.
